# Network-Delay-Time
We are given a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. We are also given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u_i, v_i, w_i), where u_i is the source node, v_i is the target node, and w_i is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

We will send a signal from a given node k and return the minimum time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the signal.
